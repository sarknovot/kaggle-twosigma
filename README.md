# kaggle-twosigma
My solution to Two Sigma competition from Kaggle.

The aim of competition was to predict probability that interest in rental listings will reach certain level. More detailed description of the competition can be find in notebook two-sigma-notebook.ipynb.

To solve the problem Python was used, particularly Pandas and Scikit-Learn libraries, and XGBoost algorithm.
